## F.A.Q.

### Why should I check my voter registration status now?

Check now to avoid any last-minute issues before the election.

### What is the Voter Bowl?

The Voter Bowl is a contest where college students win prizes by checking if they are registered to vote.

The Voter Bowl is a nonprofit, nonpartisan project of [VoteAmerica](https://www.voteamerica.com/), a national leader in voter registration and participation.

### How do I claim my prize?

Prizes vary depending on the contest. If the contest includes a prize that
can be delivered digitally and you win, we'll send you an email with further
instructions.

### What is the goal of the Voter Bowl?

In the 2020 presidential election, 33% of college students didnâ€™t vote. We believe a healthy democracy depends on more students voting.
