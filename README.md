Prepare for the ultimate showcase showdown.

We use:

- [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/)
- [Django 5](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Postgres 16](https://www.postgresql.org/)

We spend all our hipster tech tokens for this project to help us build a front-end directly in Django land. In particular, we use:

- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) via [django-htmx](https://github.com/adamchainz/django-htmx)
- [css-scope-inline](https://github.com/gnat/css-scope-inline)
- [surreal](https://github.com/gnat/surreal?tab=readme-ov-file)
- [django-slippers](https://mitchel.me/slippers/)

We'll see how this pans out.

For code cleanliness, we also use:

- [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting
- [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) for type checking
